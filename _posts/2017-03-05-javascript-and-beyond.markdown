You can find the live streamed video on [YouTube][youtube-link]{:target="_blank"}. There are many long pauses, and no audio. But, all work is shown in the video, in case you need to look back at something.

- Here is the [form][projects-form]{:target="_blank"} to submit your project preferences: You'll have to login to your smail account to fill in the form.
- Deadline to fill the form: **Monday, 6th March 2017 2359 hrs.**

References for some stuff:

- jQuery: [Codeacademy][codeacademy-jquery]{:target="_blank"}
- Bootstrap: [Tutorialspoint][tutorialspoint-bootstrap]{:target="_blank"}

For those who were not able to turn up for the session, please fill in the form and indicate your choices.
Follow [this][personal-website-post]{:target="_blank"} guide to host your personal webpage on github. Before the next week's session, please update your webpage to include some jQuery and Bootstrap sweetness.

Please feel free to email us in case you have any questions.
