Well, The WebOps Club has the answers.

Technology is all about building new stuff, and propagating it in the right way so that it creates a long lasting impact in the community. WebOps is a ever growing field with development happening every second. Many tech giants have a huge reputation today because of their ability to convey information aesthetically and lucidly through a website or an app. Inculcating the "app culture" hence proves very useful, and adds immensely to one's skillset.

The WebOps Club is a group for web-mobile-app-software-developers and internet technology enthusiasts at IITM. We educate student community on important technical skills required to survive in this rapidly expanding world of apps and things connected to internet.

So what's in store for you from the session?
