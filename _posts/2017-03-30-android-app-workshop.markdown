Greetings from The WebOps Club, CFI!


Please install Android Studio before coming to the session. It can be downloaded from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).


The procedure for installation can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html).


We suggest you go through the first seven videos of this tutorial before coming to the session: [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl).


Still, if there is any problem you can send a mail to [gokulan97@gmail.com](mailto:gokulan97@gmail.com) or [vikranth1997@gmail.com](mailto:vikranth1997@gmail.com) and get the installation completed before coming to the session.


It's better if you read the basics of [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/) before coming to the session.

Please bring:

1. Laptop fully charged, with the Android Studio installed
2. Android phone
3. USB cable (make sure it allows media transfer)

You can attend the session even if you don't have an android phone as you can us an emulator.
