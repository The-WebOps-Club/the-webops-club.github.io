The WebOps Club, CFI, IIT Madras has bagged 2nd place for a competition to create campus wide dashboard at The [5th Inter IIT Tech Meet][inter-iit] held at IIT Kanpur, on 26th March 2017.
Dashboard has been a envisioned at the club over a year ago and is coming to realisation now. We have a great team working on this. We will be launching this across insti with administration's help over the coming month.
